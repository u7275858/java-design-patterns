## Intent
The Naked Objects architectural pattern is well suited for rapid
prototyping. Using the pattern, you only need to write the domain objects,
everything else is autogenerated by the framework.

## Applicability
Use the Naked Objects pattern when

* You are prototyping and need fast development cycle
* An autogenerated user interface is good enough
* You want to automatically publish the domain as REST services

## Real world examples
